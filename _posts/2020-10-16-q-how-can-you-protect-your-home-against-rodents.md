Twice a year, I like to go down into my home’s crawl space and check for rodents. Even though the house is brand-new, it’s just as susceptible as any other property to rodent problems, especially during this season when rodents are looking for places to escape the colder weather. To prevent vermin from living rent-free under my home, I place bait boxes all throughout my crawl space. I like to focus on a few strategic choke points, like the edge of the foundation or beside sections of pipe that the critters might run along.&nbsp;

Typically, you’ll be tipped-off to a rodent problem by pellets, tiny footprints along tucked-away areas where dust has gathered, or patches of hanging insulation. As someone who sells many homes and has been involved in countless home inspections, I can confirm that rodents are a huge issue in Washington; you’ll find them in practically nine out of every 10 homes, either in the attic or the crawl space.&nbsp;

Here’s what I recommend: **Go down into your crawl space every six months and place some bait boxes or any other type of trapping system to mitigate the presence of rodents.** While down there, re-tuck any patches of hanging insulation you see. If you’re uncomfortable with the idea of handling rodents yourself, just reach out to a professional exterminator.&nbsp;

One bonus of venturing into your home’s crawl space yourself is that **you can also check on your vapor barrier,** which is designed to keep moisture from rising up into your insulation and causing mold to grow. Make sure you have a black vapor barrier that’s covering your whole foundation—you don’t want any dirt exposed.&nbsp;

I was in the crawl space of one of my other properties just last year and found a huge water leak; I traced it back to the shower, but since it was leaking down through the walls, I would never have known about had I not ventured down into the crawl space.&nbsp;

Hopefully you found these tips helpful. I know crawl spaces aren’t pretty, but neither are tons of rodents\! If you have any other real estate-related questions or topics you’d like to see my cover, reach out via phone or email. I’m always here to help\!&nbsp;
