When was the last time you did some roof maintenance? Today’s message comes from the rooftop of my rental property, which is spotless despite the fact that it’s almost 20 years old (and has another 10 good years left). Why? Because I take care of it.&nbsp;

A couple of times a year, I get on top of this roof and clear it and the connecting gutters of any debris. After that, I sprinkle some Moss Out\! powder along the ridge (extra powder for the north-facing side). Your home is one of the largest investments you’ll ever own, so I challenge you to keep your home’s roof in tiptop condition. A leaky roof can damage the rest of your home, and replacing one can cost $10,000 to $20,000. **Save yourself that kind of headache and keep your roof clean\!**

If you’d like more home maintenance tips or have any real estate questions at all for me, feel free to give me a shout. I’d love to hear from you.&nbsp;
