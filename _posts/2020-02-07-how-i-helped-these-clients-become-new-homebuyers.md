Today I’m with two new homebuyers, Jeremy and Destiny, who just officially became homeowners\!&nbsp;

Three or four years ago, Jeremy and I first started talking about buying the home they wanted. He was looking to buy a house for his family, and he wasn’t sure what to do.

He and I put together a plan, and when the market became just right a few months ago, we started into the process. Now, in just a couple of days, they’ll receive the keys to their new home.

**Overall, the process was a lot easier and quicker than they expected.**&nbsp;Here’s a shout-out to Crane Financial for their help with the process of financing the purchase. At the end of the day, my job isn’t only to provide buyers with representation on the real estate side, but also to help clients find good lenders.

Our current market is prime for homebuyers since interest rates are so low. Inventory has been scarce, but Jeremy and Destiny were able to snatch up this beautiful Marysville home anyway.

**Thanks to both of them for trusting me with their first home purchase\!** Teamwork makes the dream work.

If you have any questions about buying a home, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d be glad to help you take the next step toward homeownership.
