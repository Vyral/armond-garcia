It’s a great day in Shelton because we’ve got the “Golden Hammer” out to hammer our latest “SOLD” sign. David is a first-time homebuyer, and this is the third home that we have gone under contract with during this process. Third time’s the charm, as they say, and we’ve finally closed on a brand-new home for David.

The reason the first two deals didn’t go through was that the condition of the homes was worse than we thought upon inspection. **If we would have waived the inspection or ignored it, David wouldn’t know about issues that could have cost thousands of dollars to fix.&nbsp;**

We all get excited as homebuyers, but it’s also important to do our due diligence. In all three instances where we’ve been under contract, we inspected the home so we knew exactly what we were buying, and we eventually found the right fit.

If you have any questions for me about the process of buying or selling a home in today’s market, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
