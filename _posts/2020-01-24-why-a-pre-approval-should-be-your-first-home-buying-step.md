My friend and mortgage lender Michael Maher is joining us today to talk about the pre-approval process. The best part about it is that it’s free, so there’s no reason not to get one. Michael will help you go over your income, assets, and credit to figure out what your home purchasing budget will be. With how tight the inventory in this market, getting a pre-approval done should be the first step in the home-buying process for any buyer. If you’re looking to become a homeowner in 2020, it’s a no-brainer.&nbsp;

If you have any questions for us, feel free to reach out via phone or email today. We’d be happy to help out.
