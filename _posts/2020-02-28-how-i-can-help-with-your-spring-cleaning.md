It’s a great day in Lake Stephens, and spring is right around the corner. I’ve been getting ready for spring cleaning, and I realized that I have amassed a large collection of tools in my garage. **If you need to borrow one for your own spring cleaning, let me know.** I have pressure washers, lawnmowers, trimmers, ladders, and every kind of tool imaginable. If you need to haul something away, I have a trailer that you can borrow, too.&nbsp;

If you have other questions for me or any real estate needs that I can assist with, feel free to reach out via phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
