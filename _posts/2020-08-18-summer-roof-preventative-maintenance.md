We had a break in the weather, so I wanted to hop up on my roof to do some preventative maintenance. All kinds of debris have dropped from large trees around my home and caused pile-ups on my roof and clogs in my gutters. So the next time it rains, it’ll flow over the gutter, which can cause other issues. If this happens to your house, take a leaf blower to blast the debris from your roof and gutters.&nbsp;

Now that it’s summer, you also want to **create a mixture of 50% water and 50% bleach and spray it along the ridge cap of your roof.** When the next rain comes, it’ll wash the mixture down the roof and get rid of any excess moss that’s built up, and also eliminate any black streaks you can see. Pay special attention to the north side of your roof because that’s where most of the moss will still be since it gets less sunlight. Don’t skip preventative maintenance, or you could be dealing with much bigger headaches later.&nbsp;

If you have questions about this roof maintenance advice or real estate, call or email me. I would love to help you.
